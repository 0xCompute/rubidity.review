## About

What's happening herè?

The idea is to look at the facet vm code as-is (that is, NOT suggesting new or alternate syntax and semantics) in the review / commentary 
and start to (re)package / modular-ize 
code in "place holder" gems (waiting for adoption by the founders) such as 0xfacet and 0xfacet-typed and 0xfacet-rubidity.
